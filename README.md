## About 
A web app which takes an interesting and cool perspective of diary. It turns the traditional look of the diary and gives you features which no other e-diary does. It gives you the ability to get a detailed analysis of your day which no other traditional or e-diary has. It also has an amazing feature of adding an image to cherish your memory. It makes the boring diary writing process an interesting one and it will also give you an insight of life through the home page. <br>
This can be used by anyone of any age. Think about entering a very important day with analysis, and a photo, then looking back to it after several years, the amount of happiness and joy it brings would be immeasurable. With these features, this project overcomes the limitations of the traditional diary and also beats out the existing e-diaries. <br>
