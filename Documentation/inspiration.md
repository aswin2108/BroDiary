<h1 align='center'> Inspiration & Problem it solves ðŸ’¡ </h1>
<p>This idea was truly inspired from my childhood. My grandfather played a cruitial role in my studies and the way I see the world. The two things he used to ask me was to learn new words and their meanings to increase my vocabulory and to develop a habit of writing diary everyday. </p>

<p>From my perscpective I found learning words through a dictionary boring because of the layout and design. <br>
Also I was not able to develop the habit of writing diary because of two reasons which were: I kept on forgetting it, never found it interesting and the design was also boring.
</p>
<p>I created this app to solve this problem. With BroDiary you can learn new words and their meanings from the words section with the words changing on each refresh. With the new eligent, clean and simple design system the layout isn't boring anymore and will only show the one you want. <br>
Coming to the diary, BroDiary has a clean, eligent design and it understands you. Using the analyze feature you will now be able to analyze your day and understand how it went. It gives the analysis on four parameters, ie, possitive, negative, neutral and mixed. For the first time now you will be able to save an image in your diary entry to cherish your memory. You can add the one image you want to look into after some years. Just imagine looking into it after several years! <br>
You will be able to store all of these details including analysis, image and then retrieve it through history page.
