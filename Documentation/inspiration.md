<h1 align='center'> Inspiration & Problem it solves ðŸ’¡ </h1>
<p>This idea was truly inspired from my childhood. My grandfather played a cruitial role in my studies and the way I see the world. The one thing he ask me was to develop a habit of writing diary everyday. </p>

<p>From my perscpective I found it difficult to develop the habit because of two reasons which were: I never found the process interesting and the design was also boring.
</p>
<p>I created this app to solve this problem. BroDiary's home page has an elegant and attractive look which draws your eyes to the main content. <br>
Coming to the diary, BroDiary has a clean, eligent design and it understands you. Using the analyze feature you will now be able to analyze your day and understand how it went. It gives the analysis in one of the three parameters, ie, possitive, negative and neutral. For the first time now you will be able to save an image in your diary entry to cherish your memory. You can add the one image you want to look into after some years. Just imagine looking into it after several years! <br>
You will be able to store all of these details including analysis, image and then retrieve it through history page.
